Some GeoJSON maps

- Africa-outlines-with-countries_6.geojson : Africa map with lots of information per country.
- worldmap_1.geo.json : world map with only country name.
- world.geojson : worldmap made from 'worldmap_1.geo.json' with continent information added.
- world_centroids.geojson : centroids of every countries computed from 'world.geojson'. Centroids from Russia, Canada, USA and Norway were changed to better fit normal representation (so for those 4 countries, centroids are not the real centroids, be careful).
- gabon.geojson (map with regions delimiters from https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/src/countries/gabon.geojson
